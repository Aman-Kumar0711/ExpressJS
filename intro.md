# Express.js: A Powerful Node.js Framework

Express.js is a Node.js framework that is currently the most popular, as evidenced by its status as the most starred framework on npm. It is a web application framework that provides a simple API for building web apps, websites, and backends.

## Why Do We Need Express.js?

Express.js simplifies the process of developing with Node.js by offering a range of features and utilities. Here's why it's beneficial:

1. **Efficiency**: Using Express.js with Node.js can significantly reduce development time. The same tasks that would take numerous lines of code in plain Node.js can be accomplished in far fewer lines with Express.js.
2. **Simplicity**: Express.js abstracts away the complexity of dealing with the core modules of Node.js, making it easier to handle routing, middleware, and other web server functionalities.
3. **Flexibility**: It provides a flexible and scalable approach to developing web applications, making it easier to manage and maintain code.

## Difference

Try to write a REST API code in plain Node.js i.e., using only core modules, then write the code in Express.js, it will take 5x-10 lesser time also fewer lines of code.
