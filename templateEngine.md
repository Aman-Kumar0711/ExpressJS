# Template Engine

## About

Jab bhi humko dynamic data ke saath deal karna hota hai we use template engine in express.js
Kyun ki HTML mei tum dynamic data nahin rakh sakte iss se nipatne ke liye we use template engines.

A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.

Some popular template engines that work with Express are `Pug`, `Mustache`, and `EJS`. The Express application generator uses Jade as its default, but it also supports several others.
